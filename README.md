Yet Another BPMS (inspired in YACC - Yet Another Compiler-Compiler)

YABPMS (Yet Another BPMS is another BPMS, but with priority for the architecture of the software. 
The YABPMS's objective is to concentrate on the architecture of the solution to a problem to manage business Processes. 
The emphasis is to represent a process and manage it in all his lifecicle.

A common use case it would be:
- A Client agree with a contract of services with an organization;
- A contract in XML is validated to the system (this BPMS);
- The system automatically genateta an configuration for infrastructure creation (IaC - Infrastructure as a Code);
- Then, the optimazed IaC artfacts are executed, creating all the infrastructure, plus the system to manage the business processes.

Let's realize it! :)

P.S.: this is inspired in YACC (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler) whose free software version is available at: http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/ .
